## About

This is the configuration for my Debian distro with the i3 window manager. I'm still learning, and constantly tweaking, so these files may change quite often. 

If you're just starting out with i3 I recommend reading the [User's
Guide](https://i3wm.org/docs/userguide.html) and checking out Alex Booker's
tutorial videos [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1I63wGcvU4).

## Config

⋅ [Compton](https://github.com/chjj/compton) for compositing effects. 

⋅ [Rofi](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi) as a dmenu replacement. 

⋅ GTK theme is [Fantome](https://github.com/addy-dclxvi/gtk-theme-collections/blob/master/README.md#thunar--geany-fantome) by addy-fe. 

⋅ System-wide colors are (mostly) managed through [.Xresources](https://github.com/mobile-vulgus/.dotfiles/blob/master/.Xresources).

⋅ Main font is [bitocra13full](https://github.com/Tecate/bitmap-fonts/blob/master/README.md). i3bar font is Cantarell.

⋅ Wallpaper is [Inner Varnika](https://web.archive.org/web/20160811213124im_/http://2016.innervarnika.com/app/themes/innervarnika/dist/images/BG_1440_midres.jpg) by [Jack Vanzet](http://www.jackvanzet.com/archive)
