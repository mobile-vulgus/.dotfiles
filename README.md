# README - Dotfiles

This is my daily driver Debian setup. I started using Linux casually
about a year ago, along with i3, and I've been learning as I go. 

If you're just starting out with i3 I recommend reading the [User's
Guide](https://i3wm.org/docs/userguide.html) and checking out Alex's
great tutorial series on videos
[here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1I63wGcvU4).
